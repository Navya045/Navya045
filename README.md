- 👋 Hi, I'm Sai Navya Jyesta!
- 🚀 I'm a passionate software engineer and student at Indiana University Bloomington, where I'm pursuing my interest in full-stack development, cloud computing, and data science.
- 💻 I have hands-on experience with a variety of technologies, including the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), AWS, and Python. My projects range from creating serverless community support platforms to developing robust service management systems.
- 🎓 I'm also actively involved in academia, both as a student and a research assistant, where I help others learn and grow in the fields of Python programming, software development and data analysis.
- 🔍 Currently, I'm looking for software engineering internships to apply my skills in a professional setting and contribute to innovative projects.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at sjyesta@iu.edu for any collaboration or opportunities.
